EPUCK-118 PROJECT
=======

Description
-----------

As a part of the Robotics Project 2022 of the course MICRO-31,
we were asked to design an application with an E-Puck2 robot from GCtronic.

Using this robot, we created a miniaturised firetruck which purpose is to find fire sources in a maze
and extinguish them while transmitting at all time information to a computer to map its environment.


Run Instructions
-----------------

The code was written and run using a specialised version of Eclipse, designed to use an E-Puck2 robot
as a debugger.

The Py script was written and run using Jupyter Lab. To use the script, open a terminal in Jupyter and
run the code without forgetting to specify the Bluetooth UART Com port.
